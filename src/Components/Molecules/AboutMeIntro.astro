    Hi, My name is Fenton, and what started as a hobby has quickly become an
    obsession. <br><br> It all started with a Traversy Media tutorial on YouTube,
    learning the basics of HTML and CSS.This soon turned into many online
    lessons, where I fixated on how the web works and the roles specific
    languages have within it. Fast-forward to today, and Javascript has been my
    language of choice. With a strong interest in front-end and back-end
    methodologies, I enjoy building personal and professional projects (as seen
    below). <br><br>Recently, I have been exploring some creative technologies for web
    design, allowing me to delve further into my creative side and improve my
    projects' aesthetics.
